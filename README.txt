This code is developed and maintained by Nathaniel Knopf, Samuel Sakhai, and Shawn Shirazi

TubeCode.py and WheelCode.py are used in conjunction with each other to gather raw data.

These two scripts produce a CSV (Comma/Character Separated Value) file which Parsing.py
uses to prepare files for use with CLOCKLAB in order to produce actograms.
